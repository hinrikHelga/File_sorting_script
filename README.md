## Getting Started

What you need to do to get started. First you will need to download the script from the repository here on Github and put it onto your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You will need to have Python 3.7
If using Ubuntu:
    $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
else:
```
[Click here to download Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

```
Open a console to run the script
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

1. Step 1: Download the script from our Github
2. Step 2: Run the script - python3 clean.py /path/to/download/folder /path/to/structured/folder
3. Step 3: Profit.

### Notes

We would like to mention that the program was developed on multiple different platforms, which did not hinder the programs development progress. However, just before submission on the assignment, the final product yielded very different results. We strongly recommend running the script on a UNIX-based system.
